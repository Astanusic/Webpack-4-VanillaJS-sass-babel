# Webpack-4-Vanilla-JS

The idea is just to have a ready to code webpack config.
It actually support babel, css, sass.
It also minify css and js in an optimized way.
Production config is in a different file than Dev config.
I used WebpackMerge so the shared config options between those two files are not repeating(DRY purpose)

## Setup

`git clone https://github.com/Astanusic/Webpack-4-VanillaJS-sass-babel.git`
`$ yarn install`
